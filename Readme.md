##Bit Predict Time series


* Bitcoin price prediction using N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Interpretable Time Series 
Forecasting) algorithm. The algorithm consisted of 120 dense layers with each layer of 512 neurons. The model 
used residual connection for overcoming problems of vanishing gradient and overfit.
* Designed a series of 10 deep learning experiments for improving results and forecasting horizon. Also made the 
use of ensemble learning method by combining 5 deep learning models. 
* Introduced outliers on purpose to evaluate the effects of on training and overall model testing
